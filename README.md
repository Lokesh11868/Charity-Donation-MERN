## Thought behind the project

This project is a part of the Winter Project event conducted by AASF IIIT, Gwalior.My motive behind choosing this project was build something that can be used to resolve real world problem.I saw the ROTARACT CLUB,IIIT Gwalior was lacking a centralised secured platform,that can track the progress of various campaigns run by it.
So,I decided to come up with this project that can provide a user friendly experience, secured and ensures the tranparency of donation and privacy of donor.
